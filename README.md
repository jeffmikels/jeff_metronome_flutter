# jeffs_metronome

This is a simple metronome built with Flutter.

There are probably some optimizations that could be done. I'm not happy with the framerate of this final app. On my Motorola G7, I get errors of 4-20 milliseconds on each beat.

Of course, the metronome is self-correcting, so there is no drift, but the discerning ear can tell that every now and then a beat hits slightly late and the next beat hits slightly early.

Pull requests are welcome.
